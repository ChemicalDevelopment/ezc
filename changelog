ezcc-1.8.0 (0.8.0-16ubuntu8) trusty; urgency=low

  * factorial, gamma
    - Factorial (x) can now be computed either by a = factorial b or a = b !
    - gamma is factorial(x-1)
  * user defined functions
    - Create a file, and at the top, write #__name__ $name $args . . .
    And when you compile, you can call it with a = @$name $args
    See the examples folder for more info
  * echo, and literal c code
    - echo now works, use echo "ayy" or echo a to display ayy or var a
    - literal c code can be injected by ending the line with ; or {} enclosing
    For example, printf("ayy"); is read as C code, as is {int a;}

ezcc-1.7.0 (0.8.0-16ubuntu8) trusty; urgency=low

  * Added back mod and trunc functions, gamma, factorial, max, min, etc
    - Mostly in libMath
  * Added constants
    - NEGONE, ZERO, ONE, TWO, FOUR, TEN are their numeric values, and need no init
  * Added new operators
    - Added operators '!', '√', and '_' for factorial, square root, and trunc/multtrunc
	  Used with operators on either side, but by convention, use 'a !', '√ a', and 'a _' or 'a _ b'
    If you do use 'a _', this is equivelent to 'a _ ONE'. the _ returns the largest multiple of b (or ONE) that is less than or equal to a

ezcc-1.6.0 (0.8.0-16ubuntu8) trusty; urgency=low

  * Added regex support, including trunc, and added new multi file feature. needs documentation
    - Multi file builds are now supported, and you can declare each file as a function (strict SRP)
	  These are used with the @ sign to denote local function
