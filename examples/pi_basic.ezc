This is a basic example of calculating pi.

This is very slow. Please see pi.ezc for a faster method.

# First, set the precision in bits to whatever the end user prompts
setprec $1

# this is the starting point, and from here, we calculate more and more
pi = 3.0

# set largest to loop through

var prec
