## Release (stable) versions

TODO

## Development (unstable) versions

The master branch of the repository is the best place to get EZC

Simply, `git clone https://github.com/chemicaldevelopment/ezc`, `cd ezc`

Now, run `make -j4` to build, and `sudo make install` to install to your system

If you don't want to install, you can just run the interpreter locally: `./ec/ec -h`
