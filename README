## What is EZC?

EZC is a language/compiler which supports multiprecision, quick scripting, and a large number of platforms.

EZC also includes commandline utilities (WIP) which allow shells access to fast computations with an extended set of functions, so EZC is also a commandline calculator extension.

## INSTALLING

### Release

These are found from the releases page, and can be installed like this:

### Development Versions

You will need automake/autoconf/etc (you probably already have this)

If you have these, you will run `autoreconf -i`, then `./configure && make && sudo make install` to build.
