ezc (1.1.0) testing; urgency=med

  * added choose operator
    - `choose` is now an operator, so use var (5 choose 2)
  * printf added
    - similar to C printf, but use @F for floats, and @Z for integers
	- Also, use @{2 + 3} to print a statement
  * prompt added
    - full precision prompt from stdin.
	- call it like `x = prompt 'Enter a number'`
  * Set of statistics functions added
    - binom[c|p]df normal[c|p]df
	- These are implemented in EZC_LIB.ezc, using dogfooding
